![Starfield Modlist Photoshop Cropped](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star_Wars_Genesis_V2_for_Starfield_1.11.36/assets/170469610/7473f5e6-41f7-44e2-add5-3561df29b1be)

This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />


## **Overview:**<br />
- Complete Sound and Music Overhaul<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Factions<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />
- Star Wars Aliens<br />
- Star Wars Misc Items<br />
- Star Wars Signs, Wallpapers, Logos, and other Textures<br />
- Third Person Combat Revamped<br />
- Gameplay Enhancements and Bug Fixes<br />
- Immersive Starting Experience<br />
- 4k Textures<br />
- Optional Realism Mode<br />

## **Requirements:**
1. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
2. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass version and some of them straight up aren't compatible.
3. Mod Organizer 2. I cannot recommend Vortex. You WILL have issues and you will either notice them straight away or you will NOT notice them until it's late.
4. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. There will be some mods that won't work on an existing save but you can workaround it by looking at the FAQ
5. Version 1.11.36 of Starfield


## **Manually Installed Mods:**<br />
Please read each mod instruction carefully. They're manually installed in different places. <br />
1. Starfield Script Extender (V0.27): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106?tab=files <br />
   Add SFSE to MO2 by following these instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVri7somCI&t=85s
2. Mandalorian Collection Mesh Texture Edits: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6043?tab=files<br />
   Install just the main file. You can look into doing the optional muscular mando version if you're interested in that. <br />
   DO NOT just drag the "Main - Install First" folder inside your Data folder. This is a common mistake. Please read the instructions.
3. Starfield Hotkeys: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1578?tab=files
4. Boostpack to Jetpack (A TRUE Jetpack Experience): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3800?tab=files<br />
   I did the Forever Jetpack option but feel free to do any of the other ones.
5. Real ADS - Part 2 - Add Real Zoom: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3939?tab=files<br />
   Install the RealADS_Sniper one
6. Star Wars Mandalorian Title Screen Overhaul https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSbbV_F8L1KNOMc0d8S53sihKWz-2bt0?usp=sharing <br />
   Install Part 2 Only by putting the Data folder in the archive into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
7. Starfield Performance Boost: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/290?tab=files
   All In One (For all) 1v6 version

## **Mod Manager Modlist:** <br />
**Note: This is following the exact load order in Mod Organizer 2 from top to bottom**<br />
**Note: All google drive links are still installed by Mod Organizer 2. Just drag the archive into the downloads section of MO2 and install as you normally would**<br />
**Note: Please make sure that if you're upgrading from Genesis 1.0 or using your existing modlist as a base that you MAKE SURE you're checking that all mods are updated.**<br />

**Core**
1. Plugins.txt Enabler: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4157?tab=files
2. Address Library for SFSE Plugins (v11): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3256/?tab=files&category=archived
3. Console Command Runner (Updated): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7318?tab=files

<br />**Gameplay**

4. Star Wars Aliens (v1.1) https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8518?tab=files
5. OPTIONAL - Ascension - Gameplay Overhaul https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6839?tab=files <br /> 
The armor values in this modlist are balanced around this mod. The game will be very easy without this mod and you will have to figure out how to make it challenging and fun yourself if you choose not to install this. If you do choose to install the mod, it will be hard especially in the beginning but also very rewarding. You will have to use cover and can't just run your way through everything. Damage is very realistic and you may die in a few shots but so will your enemies unless you or they have really good armor.  All armor and weapons are static and won't be scaled to you. That means a pistol you pickup at level 2 won't be useless when you're level 10. You can read more details about it in the mod description<br /> 
*Note: You can still adjust the difficulty and damage ingame with this mod enabled.*<br /> 
*Note: Please for the love of god if you enable this mod AFTER you tried the game without it, make sure you drag the PLUGIN to it's correct place because by default it'll go to the end of the plugin list and break everything.*

## **Plugins Load Order:**<br />
I cannot stress this enough. If you don't match this on the tea then you will have issues on top of issues and I won't be able to help you.

## **Starfield Custom.ini File** <br />
If you don't have it already, create a StarfieldCustom.ini at: " C:\Users\UserName\Documents\My Games\Starfield" AND "Starfield\profiles\Default" in your MO2 directory. <br />
Download the StarfieldCustom.ini file in this Github repository and replace yours. You can also find the file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WaVrlGY144bWFqygE4MVmQcPbBng-eS7?usp=sharing) <br />

## **Experimental/Optional Mods:**<br />
1. For now, I am using Ultimate Graphic's paid Reshade which you can get from here: https://www.patreon.com/ultimategraphics/posts <br />
   If any of you know any free alternatives that look as good, please let me know in my discord :D  <br />
   Coming back to this, I actually cannot recommend this reshade. Has too many depth buffer issues especially in menus. 
   
## **IN-GAME SETUP**<br />
1. If you're using hardcore mode/ascension, make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal
2. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod
   
## **F.A.Q.**
1. How do I get the Mandalorian Armor?<br />
   It replaces the Mantis Armor. You can spawn the armor in with these console commands but just know the game will be easier than intended with it. It's an endgame unique armor that goes head to head with Celestial (Starborn) armor and the challenge to get it naturally takes some work now since it requires an Aurebesh translator: <br />
   player.additem 00226299<br />
   player.additem 0016640A<br />
   player.additem 0016640B<br />
3. Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering  Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
4. I see the Star Wars themed weapons but they don't fire lasers. How do I fix this?<br />
   Make sure all the Weapon Replacer mods are BELOW the Armor mods and overwrite them. Do the same for the esm files. This is a common problem I hear about often and if you're in this situation, that means you didn't follow the load order above at all. That is just one out of countless issues you're gonna have if you don't follow this load and plugin order.
5. I see "Lookup failed!" on some weapons and armor. How do I fix?<br />
   This used to be an issue with V1 but should not happen at all with V2. If you see this, that means one of your mods is probably the wrong version
6. Certain NPC's are missing their heads or aren't converted. How do I fix? <br />
   This happens when you mod existing saves. There are 2 possible solutions. Open console, click them, and do resetinventory. If that doesn't work, try using "disable" on them closing the console for them to disappear, and then open console and type enable. Highly recommend saving your game before hand incase you mess something up.
7. X Mod isn't working. What do i do? <br />
   Make sure you followed my load order. Make sure you followed my plugin load order. Make sure your Starfield version is V1.11.36
8. Why are some of the mods on Google Drive and not on Nexus Mods? <br />
   Because Nexus Mods is unironically anti-mod. I need permission to modify and update people's files that have been inactive and abandoned for 6+ months. Their mod isn't working anymore. No one is downloading it. No one can contact the original owner. But for some reason I'm not allowed to fix it. I also understandably can't upload any mods with Star Wars music due to copyright, but in reality it's not like Disney would actually care... To be quite honest, I don't really care about any these rules and just want to make a proper Star Wars game/modlist. I allow all my mods be modified and reuploaded freely. I have multiple backups of all files in this modlist so nothing will be ever be lost. If a mod in this list is ever deleted, mine or anyone elses, I'll have it uploaded somewhere else as soon as possible.
